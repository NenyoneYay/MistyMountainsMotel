      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience is tourists and travellers looking for a place to stay while travelling. This audience will be people aged 18-60, with a focus on heads of families</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Enjoy the Stay 
      </h4>
      <p>
        People who are travelling in the secluded area would want to come to the Motel to rest and prepare for a continuation of their journeys. My website will be for people preparing a trip through the mountains or to the mountains, looking for a warm friendly place to stay on their travels.
      </p>
      <h4>Common Questions</h4>
      <p>
        Some questions my website’s visitors will expect answered by my website are information about the surrounding area, prices, availability and variety of room options, the amenities they would be receiving if they stay at the motel, and what days the motel is open/closed on.
	    </p>
      <h4>Our Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        Some activities my website’s visitors would complete on my website include booking a room, contacting the motel staff, checking prices and learning about the nearby activities that tourists/travellers can expect to do. They might look for a map of the area specialized for travellers indicating points of interest.
      </p>
      <h4>Needed Information</h4>
      <p>
        Some information that is necessary is information on what pricing options there are for motel rooms, information about surrounding activities and events that tourists would want to know about and could be advertised on the website, and a map of the area. While I initially planned this website to be for a fictional location, it may be best to select a hypothetical area to locate the motel at (Mount Rainier, or something similar) so I can include a real map of the area.
      </p>
      <h4>Why choose us?</h4>
      <p>
        Visitors will come to my website because of its cozy atmosphere, promising an enjoyable stay at the motel that is preferable to other websites offers.
      </p>
      <h4>About the Misty Mountains:</h4>
      <p>
        In this page, we'll include information meant to sell the idea of vacationing in the area, 
        as well as information about the motel to entice and convince people to stay at the motel. 
        Some information could include facts about the area ("did you know that ___ mountain is home 
        of the tallest Pine trees in North America?") and other fluff paragraphs to upsell the area. 
        Pictures will include scenic shots of nature and picturesque beauty. In addition, there will be 
        information about the motel itself, including amenitites offered, rooms available, pictures of the 
        interior/exterior, and advertisements such as "our quiet, out of the way location will ensure 
        peace of mind as you rest, while also being located only a short drive from all the entertainment 
        and activities the area has to offer!"
      </p>
      <h4>Events</h4>
      <p>
        This is where a list of current events happening in the area would be included. 
        This could include locations, times and descriptions, such as 
        "Local band _____ will be performing in the Harold Lee park on June 14th at 9:00" 
        perhaps including links to other webpages for more information.
        Some images can include famous events that were held in the past, such as 
        concerts and conventions. It can include links to other partner websites, because
        the more people frequent the nearby events and activities, the more people would need a place
        to stay as they enjoy them.  
      </p>
      <h4>Activities</h4>
      <p>
        This is where a list of activities that can be enjoyed by tourists visiting 
        the motel will be placed. For example: "Enjoy the thrill of skiing at Bobs skii-hill, 
        conveniently only 2 miles from our location"
        Some images can include people having fun doing outdoors activities such as ropes courses, skiing, sledding, hiking, swimming, etc.
        This page would ideally have activities grouped up based on indoor/outdoor activities so customers could 
        find exactly what they are looking for easily and efficiently.
